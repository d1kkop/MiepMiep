# MiepMiep

MiepMiep is a network library that covers both low level implementation as
well as it offers high level features.

Features (ultimate goal)
  - Always connect;
  - Store synchronizable variables in any class;
  - Highly parallel design (almost all functions thread-safe);
  - Send/recv type safe RPC's, taking full adv. of C++11;
  - Automatic MTU dicovery and congestion control for maximum throughput;
  - Scales easily to pratically any client count;
  - Support for both client-server & p2p design;
  - Automatic host migration on board.
  
  MiepMiep has been unit-tested, analyzed by plenty of coding programs, profiled, memory-leak checked
  and optimized contineously.
